# C++ Sentiment Analysis Engine

A C++ project demonstrating core AI, NLP, and data engineering concepts — built from scratch using modern C++ (C++17+), JSON-based data, and modular architecture.

This project mimics how production AI systems work under the hood — focusing on clean data preprocessing, feature extraction, and sentiment analysis logic.

## Day 1 Project Setup & JSON Integration

- Set up the C++ project environment, integrate JSON parsing, and test data reading.
- Initialized a modular CMake project structure:

```bash
cpp-sentiment-engine/
├── src/
├── include/
├── data/
├── external/
├── build/
└── CMakeLists.txt
```

- Installed and used the nlohmann/json library for JSON parsing.
- JSON parsing validated and ready for AI integration.
